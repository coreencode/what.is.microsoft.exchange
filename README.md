Exchange is Microsoft's groupware server, originally developed for corporate customers. Like other groupware solutions, it includes communication and organizational features, including:

* Email hosting
* A calendar component, including collaborative features like meeting invites, shared calendars, and bookable resources
* Contact management providing an organization-wide address book, as well as personal contact stores
* Collaborative task management, such as the ability to delegate tasks to another user
* Sticky notes, files, and others
* Exchange itself is the server application that stores and manages all of this data for you. So, as a server program, how does this impact you? Well, it's the engine that powers two tools you might be very familiar: Microsoft Outlook, and its web-based cousin, Outlook Web Access.
